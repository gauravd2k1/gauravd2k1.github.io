    <h1>Privacy Policy for QuickRev</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 19/09/2024</p>

    <p>At QuickRev, developed by an individual developer (Gaurav Dwivedi), your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the QuickRev mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Images and Text Data:</strong> The app allows users to take photos of book pages or documents, which are processed via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information related to your use of the app, such as device information (e.g., model, OS version) and app interaction data to improve the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> The extracted text is sent to the OpenAI API to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing Data:</strong> The images and extracted text are processed locally on your device and sent to third-party services like OpenAI to generate relevant MCQs for your learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving the App:</strong> Usage data helps us understand how users interact with QuickRev, enabling us to improve functionality and features.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and Security:</strong> We use the data to ensure compliance with legal obligations and to protect the app against misuse or unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>QuickRev uses third-party services to process the extracted text and generate MCQs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> We send the extracted text to the OpenAI API to create learning material based on your input. The data sent to OpenAI is only used for this purpose and is not stored by QuickRev.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that OpenAI may have its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review it for details on how your data is handled.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image and Text Data:</strong> QuickRev does not store any images or extracted text permanently on any servers. All data is processed locally on your device, and any data sent to third-party services is not retained after processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Requesting Data Deletion:</strong> If you wish to delete the app or any associated data, you can do so by uninstalling the app. As no personal data is stored, uninstallation will remove all relevant information from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Consent and Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By using QuickRev, you agree to the collection and processing of the data as described in this Privacy Policy. You will be required to review and accept this Privacy Policy before you can start using the app. We will prompt users to agree to the Privacy Policy during their first app launch, and you must accept it to use QuickRev.</p>

    <h2>6. Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>We take data security seriously. Although no data transmission over the Internet or mobile networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, reasonable measures are taken to protect your data and ensure its confidentiality.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I, Gaurav Dwivedi, reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If any changes are made, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted within the app, and users will be notified of any significant changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
